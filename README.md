# motherfucking-to-do-list

Inspired by the Odin Project: [to do list](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-todo-list)

22/12/23: I don't like how this thing is coming along. I started doing some prototyping in the sandbox repo and even that's falling to bits. So, inspired by [motherfuckingwebsite](https://motherfuckingwebsite.com/), I'm gonna delete the repo and start over with a simple html to-do list. If I need my previous work I can go back to a former commit. (also, the Odin Project made fun of bootstrap and I was like lol I've been using this the whole time)

24/12/23: The idea of this was that I was supposed to use this as an opportunity to learn webpack... but then I added webpack and it fucked everything up. So now this is just a basic ass website... but it's a functional website. Shit works. And without webpack I feel it's more in the spirit of motherfuckingwebsite. [So here's a motherfucking to-do list.](https://vaticanmemes.github.io/motherfucking-to-do-list/)
